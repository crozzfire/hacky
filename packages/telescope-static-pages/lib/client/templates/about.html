		<h3>So what exactly is Hacky?</h3>
		<p>
			You must have heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathons</a>. Whether you're a regular hacker or someone who's thinking of participating in one, there is always a constant struggle. Thats mainly because the web has very few resources for hackathons. The little that we have are either scattered or not archived. Hacky is a purely community run epicentre for all hackathon resources. 
		</p>

		<br><br>

		<h3>So how does Hacky solve it?</h3>
		<p>
			Inspired by crowdsourced news sites like Hacker News, Producthunt and Reddit, we wanted to build Hacky in a similar fashion. That said, we also knew that fellow hackers primarily face a few well known problems. 3 categories were hence identified:			

			<div style="padding-top:10px">
				<h4>Hacks</h4>
				<p>
					If you ever attended a Hackathon, you would have easily figured out that the "best" way to do something is actually suboptimal. What really counts is the "fastest" way of getting things done -  Rapid Prototyping. This thread is made exactly for that.   
				</p>	
				<br>	
				<h4>Showcase</h4>
				<p>
					It sucks to be a hackathon regular and see the your hacks go to /dev/null after the hackathon. This is the right place for you to showcase your hacks, get more eyeballs and take it to the next level. Do not let your code goto waste.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Boilerplates</h4>
				<p>
					There are always things that needs to be re-done everytime you work on a new hack. Rewriting boilerplate code is a complete waste of time and takes away the focus on the "real problem" that you are trying to fix. If you have come across or have built an awesome boilerplate, this is the right place to share it!
